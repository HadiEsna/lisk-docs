== Overview


The advent of Blockchain technology has resulted in a wide array of many positive benefits on a global scale, whereby numerous blockchain applications are found in a variety of different industry sectors worldwide.
Blockchain growth continues to march forward exponentially offering more and more innovative and limitless solutions, from revolutionizing and boosting security, to digital property rights, and many more.
However, this does not come without its challenges, as the many blockchains continue to grow and expand, coupled with the enormous growth in users, this subsequently results in scalability issues, which in turn result in transaction latency problems.
In this section, we will explore scalability and cover the solutions available to address this with a view to reducing and eliminating blockchain latency.


== What is blockchain scalability?

Scalability in this context can be defined as the platform or system's ability to manage and support an increasing amount or quantity of tasks, namely an increasing amount of transactions together with an increasing amount of nodes in the network.
Generally, blockchain networks suffer from low scalability.
In the blockchain world, this mostly refers to the transaction throughput, bootstrap time, latency, and even the cost of the actual transaction.
A blockchain network can be classed as scalable when it is able to adequately handle a high volume of transactions per second (TPS), usually by the adjustment of certain system characteristics such as its consensus mechanism.

== Defining blockchain scalability

As growth in blockchain networks continues to increase exponentially, this naturally results in an ever-increasing number of nodes within the blockchain networks. This in turn raises the issue of scalability.
Probably one of the best comparisons to make here to highlight the scalability issues would be to consider the number of transactions processed in the Bitcoin network, which currently runs to around 7 transactions per second. If we compare this to the well-known Visa card processing system, the number of transactions processed every second is around 17,000. To compound this further issues with its practical applications and the difficulties when an increased number of users wish to use the network occur, as this causes the transaction process to slow down, and often increases the transaction costs, whilst restricting further users from joining the network.
There are various factors that define blockchain scalability, and generally speaking these consist of networking, capacity, and throughput.

There are various factors that define blockchain scalability, and generally speaking these consist of networking, capacity, and throughput.
With regard to networking, every type of transaction that occurs is transmitted to all nodes residing in the network.
This can consume a vast amount of network resources coupled with increasing propagation delays.
Secondly, the capacity and cost also factor into this equation, as storing large quantities of data is a requirement.
Starting from the genesis block to the latest block and transactions consists of a large quantity of data, so it has to be taken into consideration that each network node does not possess adequate resources for the storage of such high volumes of data.



== Scalability bottlenecks

As mentioned above in order to achieve scalability there are various challenges to be overcome.
To highlight these problems often regarded as bottlenecks, it is evident that the main issues consist of the following points:

- Block Size

This is one of the key issues with regard to scalability, as the block size significantly impacts the network capacity and speed.
There is a size limit for each block created which is known as the block limit.
As we have previously learned, blocks contain both actual data together with the transaction data.
For example, Bitcoin has a block limit of 1Mb.
The logic behind setting this limit was to prevent the miners from creating blocks that would be considered too large for other miners to accept.
However, limiting the block size results in reducing the transaction speed, as if a low limit is used then the that transaction can be stored in the block, and subsequently will have to wait to generate a new block.
This in turn limits the speed of transactions being validated, hence slowing down the entire process in the blockchain network.
In addition, when increasing the block size this also has an impact, as this requires an increase in the node’s storage capacity.
Furthermore, if a node is required to upload a substantially large block into the network, this can cause delays in processing the transfer, and could cause a loss of synchronization resulting in temporary chain splits.

- Response time

As in all blockchain networks, each transaction has to be validated as described in the ‘how blockchain works’ page.
Naturally, as the transaction volumes increase, this in turn increases the load on the network, and transactions are queued, which subsequently slows the process down.
This can easily result in very high TPS (transactions per second), rates.
In addition, this can also result in transaction fees increasing.
Effectively managing the load and transaction speeds are intertwined and are two of the key challenges to be overcome, hence why this metric is continually in the spotlight and developers are actively engaged in reducing the TPS.

- Limitations

As the blockchain grows and more and more transactions are processed, with increasing block sizes this is the crux of the issue, as there is in an inherent danger of overloading the network, coupled with the existing hardware limitations being utilized by many of the nodes, whereby they are simply unable to handle the vast quantities of data and bandwidth requirements.

== Scalability trilemna

As the scalability issue is always at the forefront of efficiently managing blockchain networks, it is important to familiarize ourselves with the key issues here.
This can be characterized  by refering to the blockchain networks ability to handle the continuing growth, ensuring the security is not compromised in any wave, shape or form, whilst continuing to maintain the node synchronization, transparency, and fairness together in a fully functional decentralized network.
Ultimately, to achieve this it results in a trade-off, as depicted in the scalability trilemma diagram below.

The scaling trilemma is classed as somewhat of a loose concept, implying that there is a trade-off between these three key components here, namely decentralization, security, and scalability.
Therefore, it is always a challenge to maximise the other two components without compromising the third, as can be seen in the following diagram below.
In this hypothetical example, if we were to improve scalability this requires compromising on decentralization and security.
However, it should be noted that as decentralization is a constant, a proportional relationship between scalability and security exists.
Hence, it is evident that a blockchain network is unable to optimize scalability, decentralization, and security simultaneously. As a result we have to accept trade-offs.
