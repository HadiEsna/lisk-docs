== Overview

Interoperability can simply be defined as set of techniques that enable different blockchains to communicate, and transfer digital assets between each other.
As each blockchain has been designed to operate on a different set of rules, having the possibility of connecting or performing transactions between them opens up a myriad of possibilities.
For example, these consist of such invaluable use cases as being able to transfer one type of crypto currency from one completely different blockchain to another, and also allowing the trading of an asset on one chain for a different asset on another chain.
