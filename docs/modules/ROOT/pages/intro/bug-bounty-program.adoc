== Overview

The Lisk bug bounty program is a long-standing initiative designed to offer an incentive in the form of a remuneration payment to anyone who locates any bugs or vulnerabilities that may exist within the existing Lisk core network.

All developers and researchers who report security vulnerabilities and bugs in Lisk Core may be eligible for a payment in accordance with our guidelines which are explained in more detail on this page.
Firstly, please ensure before making any submissions that you have reviewed our bug bounty program policy rules below.

=== Focus on Lisk Core

Only vulnerabilities and bugs in Lisk Core are being considered. Focus on the master branch and, if one exists, the latest Betanet branch only.
Right now any vulnerability existing within Lisk Core, is likely to be present in the Lisk SDK as well.


=== Stay on your private network
Only test on your own private network.
A report is only eligible if it is clear that the reporter did not abuse this bug on one of the public networks.
