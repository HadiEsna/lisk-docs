The open Lisk communication architecture is based on {url_ipc_socket}[IPC Unix Sockets] and WebSocket.
The `Application` exposes an IPC socket that can be used by internal components such as modules and plugins, and by any external service like other scripts in JS, a tool in Rust, or a Python daemon.
These external services can connect to this socket and listen to events in the network, or invoke various actions of the `Application`.

== Action and event interfaces

The Lisk Framework defines actions and events which can be invoked and subscribed through a channel.

All modules and plugins will be given a `channel` to communicate with the application via actions and events.

=== The API client

The API client can be imported in any JS client application.

It allows sending API requests to a node via IPC or WS.

It also provides an interface to *subscribe* to all events and to *invoke* actions of the blockchain application and its' modules & plugins.

NOTE: The `apiClient` can also be imported from the xref:{url_elements_client}[@liskhq/lisk-client] package.

.Websocket API client example
[source,js]
----
const { createIPCClient, createWSClient } = require('@liskhq/lisk-api-client');
let clientCache;

const getClient = async () => {
  if (!clientCache) {
    clientCache = await createWSClient('ws://localhost:8080/ws');
  }
  return clientCache;
};

const useClient = async () => {
  const client = await getClient();
  const blockAtHeight123 = await client.block.getByHeight(123);
  client.subscribe('app:block:new', ( data ) => {
    console.log('new block:', data);
  });
  return blockAtHeight123;
};

useClient().then((val) => {
  console.log('val:', val);
});
----

TIP: More information about the API Client can be found at the xref:{url_rpc_endpoints}[] page.

=== Aliases

xref:{url_rpc_events}[Events] and xref:{url_rpc_actions}[actions] are identified by their alias.

Example alias: `monitor:getTransactionStats`

The alias always consists of the following parts:

. Prefix: Consists of the module or plugin name that provides the respective action or event.
Equals `app` if it's an application event or action.
. Separator:
Prefix and suffix are always separated by a colon `:`.
. Suffix: The respective name of the event or action.

=== How to publish and subscribe to events

Events are published inside lifecycle hooks of the module.
The `channel` is available inside the lifecycle hooks, which allows to subscribe and publish to events, as well as invoking actions in the network.

.Publishing an event
[source,typescript]
----
channel.publish('pluginAlias:timestamp', { info: 'sample' });
----

Subscribe to an event by utilizing <<the-api-client>>.

.Subscribing to an event
[source,typescript]
----
client.subscribe('pluginAlias:timestamp', ( data ) => {
  console.log(data);
});
----

TIP: More information about available events and actions can be found at the xref:{url_rpc_endpoints}[] page.

=== How to invoke actions

The first argument is always the alias.
If input data is required, it is provided as second argument.

.Examples: How to invoke different kind of actions with the API client
[source,typescript]
----
const data = await client.invoke('app:getSchema'); <1>
const data = await client.invoke('app:actionName', input); <2>
client.invoke('monitor:getTransactionStats').then((val) => { <3>
    console.log(val);
});
