****
The Lisk SDK is an open-source software development kit which enables developers to build scalable xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[] in JavaScript.
****

== Highlights

The most important highlights and features of the Lisk SDK:

* **One blockchain per app**: xref:{url_blockchain_apps}[] each run on their own customized blockchain.
* Programming language: image:js-logo.png[JS logo, 32] **(JavaScript) & image:ts-logo.png[TS logo, 32] (TypeScript)**
* Consensus algorithm: *xref:{url_protocol_dpos}[Lisk DPoS] & xref:{url_protocol_bft}[Lisk BFT]*
* Completely modular: Configure, exchange or extend any of the blockchain related logic in the application with *xref:{url_introduction_modules}[] and xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[]*.
* *Convenient development tools*:
** xref:{url_references_commander}[Lisk Commander]:
*** xref:{url_guides_setup_bootstrapping}[Bootstrap] a complete default blockchain application with a *single command*.
*** Generate skeletons for modules, assets, and plugins.
*** Use the Lisk SDK libraries directly in the terminal via the interactive Lisk console.
*** Many other convenient CLI tools such as creating glossterm:accounts[{glossary-account}], encrypting passphrases / messages and more.
** xref:{url_references_dashboard_plugin}[]: Communicate conveniently with your blockchain application during development via a dashboard.
** xref:{url_references_test_suite}[SDK testing utilities]: simplifies the testing of all components of a blockchain application by providing dedicated fixtures, mocks, and utility functions.
* *Interoperable* (coming soon, see {url_lisk_roadmap}[roadmap^]): Make your app interoperable with other blockchain applications, by registering it as a sidechain on the Lisk Mainchain.

== Quickstart

The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is explained here.

=== Supported Operating Systems

The Lisk SDK will run on both the Ubuntu and MacOS operating systems listed below:

[tabs]

=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
* 18.04 (LTS)
* 20.04 (LTS)
--
MacOS::
+
--
* 10.13 (High Sierra)
* 10.14 (Mojave)
* 10.15 (Catalina)
* 11.04 (Big Sur)
--
=====

NOTE: Please note that the SDK does not come with any official support for Windows.

=== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Git | v2 (latest)
|Node.js | v12.22.7 (NPM version 6.14.15)
|Lisk Commander | v5.1.7 (latest)
|===

==== Node.js

If you are using NVM, (Node.js Version Manager), ensure you install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.7
----

NOTE: The correct version for NPM(6) is installed automatically with version 12 of Node.js.

==== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM (Node Package Manager), to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-commander
----

=== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
mkdir new_app
cd new_app
----

.new_app/
[source,bash]
----
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.
----
Using template "lisk-ts"
Initializing git repository
Updating .liskrc.json file
Creating project structure
? Application name new_app
? Application description My blockchain application
? Author mona
? License ISC
----

=== Start the application

Execute the following command to start the blockchain application.

.new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

To verify that the application has started, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis glossterm:delegate[An account which performed the delegate registration and is now able to receive votes.]s and will begin adding new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

//TODO: Create updated gif with the new command
//image:node-start.gif[]

NOTE: The xref:{url_references_cli}[application CLI] offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

To see an overview of all the available CLI commands, execute the following commands in the root folder of the application:

.new_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run --help
----

=== Using the application CLI globally

To use the application commands globally, create an alias in the `.bashrc` file.

.~/.bashrc/
[source,bash]
----
alias new_app="$HOME/new_app/bin/run" # <1>
----

<1> Adjust to the path where your `new_app` is located.

After updating the `.bashrc` file, make it directly available in the terminal by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.bashrc
----

Now it is possible to conveniently run the application CLI commands from anywhere by referring to the alias.

[source,bash]
----
new_app --help
----

.Next steps
****
After completing these steps, the default blockchain application of the Lisk SDK will now be running.

It is now possible to customize your application by registering new xref:{url_introduction_modules}[] and xref:{url_introduction_plugins}[], and also adjusting the genesis block and config to suit your specific use case.

More information can be found in the following guides:

* xref:{url_guides_setup}[]
* xref:{url_guides_module}[]
* xref:{url_guides_asset}[]
* xref:{url_guides_plugin}[]
* xref:{url_guides_config}[]
* xref:{url_guides_dashboard}[]
