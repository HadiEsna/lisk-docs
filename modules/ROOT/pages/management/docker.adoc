== Start

.Inside of the `lisk-service` root folder
[source,bash]
----
make up
----

This will start Lisk Service with the default configuration, which in turn will connect to a Lisk Core Mainnet node.

In case a different node or network shall be used, xref:{url_config}[configure] Lisk Service accordingly.

== Stop

.Inside of the `lisk-service` root folder
[source,bash]
----
make down
----

This will stop Lisk Service.

== Show status of Docker containers

[source,bash]
----
docker ps
----

== Logging

To check the logs for the different microservices of Lisk Service, use the command `docker container logs CONTAINER`, where `CONTAINER` is the respective Docker container that holds the logs you wish to view.

For example, to see the logs for the Gateway microservice, execute:

[source,bash]
----
docker container logs lisk-service_gateway_1
----
