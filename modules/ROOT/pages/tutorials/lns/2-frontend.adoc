== Using a plugin as frontend

The SDK Dashboard plugin is nice to use during development of th blockchain application, because it offers a simple way to interact with the blockchain application through a user interface.
To make it more convenient for normal users to use the application, add a frontend to the application which is specialized on the respective use case of the LNS applicationn.

For the LNS app, we want to provide a simple *frontend as a plugin*, which is registered to the LNS blockchain application.
See the xref:{url_bapps_frontend}[Frontend & Backend] section for more information about the different possibilities to provide a frontend for a blockchain application.

== The React frontend application

A simple {url_reactjs}[React.js web^] application is used as frontend.
The development of the React application is not covered in this tutorial in detail.
Instead, we will use the existing React frontend in the {url_sdkexamples_lns_uiplugin}[lisk-sdk-examples repository^] and see how it can be included as a standalone UI plugin for a blockchain application.

TIP: If you want to learn more about how to develop a React frontend application, check out the {url_reactjs_docs}[React.js documentation^].

.lisk-name-service/
[source,bash]
----
cd .. # <1>
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples.git # <2>
cp -R lisk-sdk-examples/tutorials/lisk-name-service/lns-dashboard-plugin lisk-name-service/lns-dashboard-plugin # <3>
----

<1> Move out of the `lisk-name-service` folder.
<2> Clone the `lisk-sdk-examples` repository.
<3> Copy the LNS Dashboard plugin to the root folder of your LNS blockchain application.

As you might notice when looking at the files, the LNS Dashboard plugin is based on the code of the {url_sdk_dashboardplugin}[Dashboard plugin^] from the Lisk SDK Framework.

The file structure of the UI plugin is basically a merge of a React.js application and a Lisk plugin.
The main logic of the React application is located under `lns-dashboard-plugin/src/ui/`, and the main logic fie the LNS UI Plugin is located in `lns-dashboard-plugin/src/app/`.

.Creating a standalone UI plugin
****
There is no need to generate any files newly, as we simplified the process by downloading the prepared frontend plugin for the LNS blockchain application.
But in case you want to create your own standalone plugin from scratch, you can use Lisk Commander to generate a plugin skeleton, just like it was done when generating the <<bootstrapping-the-default-application, Modules>> and <<assets>> skeletons:

.lisk-name-service/
[source,bash]
----
$ lisk generate:plugin --standalone lnsui
Using template "lisk-ts"
Initializing git repository
Updating .liskrc.json file
Creating plugin project structure
? Author of plugin mona
? Version of plugin 0.1.0
? Name of plugin lnsui
? Description of plugin A plugin for an application created by Lisk SDK
? License of plugin ISC
----
****

== Adding the plugin to the LNS blockchain application

Open the `package.json` file and add the downloaded LNS Dashboard plugin to the dependencies:

.lisk-name-service/lns/package.json
[source,json]
----
{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "lns-dashboard-plugin": "file:../lns-dashboard-plugin"
  // ...
}
----

Now open `plugins.ts`, import the UI plugin, and register it with the application as shown below:

.lisk-name-service/lns/src/app/plugins.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import { Application } from 'lisk-sdk';
import { DashboardPlugin } from "@liskhq/lisk-framework-dashboard-plugin";
import { FaucetPlugin } from "@liskhq/lisk-framework-faucet-plugin";
import { LNSDashboardPlugin } from 'lns-dashboard-plugin';

export const registerPlugins = (app: Application): void => {
    app.registerPlugin(DashboardPlugin);
    app.registerPlugin(FaucetPlugin);
	app.registerPlugin(LNSDashboardPlugin);

	// Adjust the config of the LNSDashboardPlugin
	app.overridePluginOptions(LNSDashboardPlugin.alias, {
		applicationUrl: `ws://localhost:${app.config.rpc.port}/ws`,
		port: 8000,
	});
};
----

Save and close `plugins.ts`.
Restart the LNS blockchain application to apply the changes.

.lisk-name-service/lns/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

After the application has loaded, it is possible to acceess the LNS Dashboard under http://localhost:8000.

Use the credentials of the account that was created newly in the previous step xref:{url_lns_1_newacc}[Create new account] of Chapter 1 to connect to the LNS frontend.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-connected.png[UI connected,200,100]

At the top right corner you will now see the domain that was defined as <<define-a-reverse-lookup-address,reverse lookup>> for the account address.
If you tick of the slider `Enable LNS`, the address of the account will be displayed again, instead of the domain name.

By clicking on your account you will reach the following page, giving all important information about your account and the domain names that are registered for this account.
Currently, one domain name is registered to the account.
This was done in step xref:{url_lns_1_register}[Register Domain] of Chapter 1 via the Dashboard plugin.

You can also see the new TXT record that was added to the LNS object.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-account-page.png[UI account page,200,100]

Go back to the index page of the LNS Dashboard and search for a new domain name to add to your account.

The LNS Dashboard will automatically check its' availability.
If no other user has registered tis domain at the moment, it will provide a link to a dialog to register the new domain.

In the screenshot, we search for the domain `awesome.lsk`, and luckily, it isn't taken, yet.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-search-results.png[UI search results,200,100]

Click on the `Register` link to open the dialog to register the domain.

The minimum fee of the Register transaction is calculated automatically, after all required transaction data is pasted in the fields.
Please make sure to always use at least the minimum fee for the transaction, or it will bee rejected by the blockchain application.

Hit kbd:[Register] to send the domain name registration to the LNS blockchain application.

Wait for confirmation of the LNS app to have received your transaction.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-register-dialog.png[UI register dialog,200,100]
image:tutorials/lns/ui-confirmation.png[UI confirmation,200,100]

Now go back to your account page.
You should see the new domain name listed there.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-account2.png[UI account page 2,200,100]
image:tutorials/lns/ui-account-awesome-details.png[UI domain details,200,100]

Unfortunately, on the top right, our address is still resolving to the `my-name.lsk` domain (if LNS is enabled).
So let's update the reverse lookup of the account to point to the new domain name `awesome.lsk`.

Open the Dialog for updating the reverse lookup by clicking on kbd:[Update reverse lookup] in the top right.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-reverse-lookup-dialog.png[UI reverse lookup dialog,200,100]

Choose `awesome.lsk` from the dropdown menu, enter the account passphrase and the minimum fee.

Click kbd:[Update] to update the reverse lookup entry for this account.
As a result, you can verify that the LNS Dashboard now resolves the account address automatically to the new domain name `awesome.lsk`.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-updated.png[UI updated name,200,100]

Try to search again for the domain name `awesome.lsk`.
The search results should now inform you that this domain name is already reserved.

image:tutorials/lns/ui-reach-reserved.png[UI search for reserved name,200,100]

Play around as much as you like with the LNS application UI.

The development of frontend and backend of the LNS application is now complete, and the application has all the features that were described in the xref:{url_lns_0}[LNS application overview] at the top.

In the next chapter, the LNS application CLI will be enhanced with commands specific to the LNS module.
This allows to interact with the blockchain application directly via the command-line, which can be beneficial for developers and/or node operators.
