The goal of Part 3 covers how to implement a complete workflow of a simple version of a supply chain tracking system.

The following points below are covered in this section:

* How to implement the missing transactions types `RegisterPacket`, `StartTransport` and `FinishTransport`.
* How to cache multiple accounts in the `prepare` step.
* How to implement a simple trust system.
* How to lock funds in an account.
* How to execute a first complete test run of the supply chain tracking system.

NOTE: It is recommended to view the xref:{url_tutorials_transport_procedure}[diagram on the Introduction page], which will help the user to have an overiew of the workshop.

[TIP]
====
"Are there more of those... solutions?"::
{url_github_transport_solutions}[Yes, there are more!^], check out the fully working implementation of the other transactions in the `transactions/solutions/` folder.

After completing a task, compare with the solutions in order to verify if the task has been successfully completed.
However, be aware that there is not only just one valid solution to write the code.
In step 3.3 later in this section, the actual code will be run to verify it functions correctly.

[[register_packet]]
== 3.0 Implement RegisterPacket

To move on to the next step in the prototype it is necessary to implement the `RegisterPacket` transaction.
This transaction will register a packet on the blockchain that is ready to be picked up by a delivery person.
The transaction allows the package owner to define the following properties:

* `packetId`: The ID of the packet account (registered on Raspberry Pi).
* `postage`: The postage refers to a number of LSK tokens the carrier receives upon successful delivery of the packet.
The postage is stored in the packet account's asset field.
* `security`: The security refers to a number of LSK tokens that the carrier should lock as a "security" before the packet can be accepted for delivery.
Upon successful delivery, the security regarding the carriers balance will be unlocked again.
* `minTrust`: This minimum trust property has been introduced to keep track of well behaving/performing carriers.
Whenever a carrier successfully delivers a packet, their trust will be increased by a factor of one.
The package owner can set a minimal trust level for a carrier before he/she can accept the package for delivery.
If a carrier has a lower trust than the minimal required trust level, it is not possible to accept the package for delivery.
* `recipientId`: Please note that this is a highly important field, as it sets the actual recipient who will receive the package.

For the `RegisterPacketTransaction` the following guide runs through the `undoAsset()` function and explains how this can be achieved. This in turn allows the user to implement the following small snippet of code shown below:

=== Task: Complete the implementation of the `undoAsset` function.

Please note a small part of the logic is missing whereby the packet account was reset to its original state.

Now try to implement the {url_github_transport_registerpkt160}[missing logic^] for `undoAsset()` by reverting the steps of the `applyAsset()` function.

**Important: To verify the implementation of `undoAsset()`, compare it with the {url_github_transport_registerpkt}[solution^].**

=== Explanation: `undoAsset(store)`

The `undoAsset` function is responsible for informing the blockchain how to revert changes that have been applied via the `applyAsset` function.
This is very useful in case of a fork whereby it is necessary to change to a different chain.
In order to accomplish this it is necessary to roll back blocks and apply new blocks of a new chain.
Hence, when rolling back blocks it is necessary to update the account state of the affected accounts.
Please note that this is the reason why writing the logic for the `undoAsset` function should never be skipped.

== 3.1 Start the transport

For the next step it is now required to implement the `StartTransport` transaction.
This transaction indicates the start of the transportation as the carrier picks up the package from the sender.

When creating the `StartTransport` transaction, the carrier defines the following:

* `packetId`: The ID of the packet that the carrier is going to transport.
The `packetId` is not sent in the asset field, but is assigned to the `recipientId` property of the transaction.

This transaction will perform the following:

* Lock the specified `security` of the packet in the carrier's account.
This security cannot be accessed by the carrier, unless the transport has been finished successfully.
* Add the `carrier` to the packet account.
* Set the `status` of the packet from `pending` to `ongoing`.

The `StartTransportTransaction` , the `prepare(),and the `undoAsset()` functions are described below, including implementing the security locking of the carriers account:

            const carrierTrust = carrier.asset.trust ? carrier.asset.trust : '0';
            if (BigInt(packet.asset.minTrust) <= BigInt(carrierTrust) && carrier.balance >= BigInt(packet.asset.security)) {
                /**

        return errors;

}

----

=== Task: Lock funds

To lock the funds, simply deduct the number of tokens locked from the account's balance.

[source,js]
----
const carrierBalanceWithoutSecurity = carrierBalance - packetSecurity;
----

Next, store the deducted number of tokens in a custom property in the `asset` field.
This provides the ability to keep track of the amount of tokens locked as security.

{url_github_transport_start53}[Insert your own code here^]:
Create an updated object for the carrier account that substracts the `security` from the carriers balance, and add a new property `lockedSecurity` to the `asset` field of the carriers account.
The `lockedSecurity` should exactly equal the amount deducted from the carriers `balance`.

NOTE: To unlock locked tokens, remove or nullify the custom property in the `asset` field and add the number of tokens again to the account's `balance`.

**Important: To verify the implementation, please compare it with the {url_github_transport_solutions_start}[solution^].**

=== Explanation: `prepare()`

The prepare function here is caching both the carrier account through the `senderId` and the packet account through the `recipientId`.

_Why is it possible to cache two accounts at the same time?_ Please notice that the cache function accepts an array which allows it to pass in multiple query objects.
When a pass in an array to the cache function is made, it will try to find a result for each query object.

It is also possible to pass in just one query object without a surrounding array.
In this case, only objects that exactly match this query object will be cached as shown below:

[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
        await store.account.cache([
            {
                address: this.asset.recipientId,
            },
            {
                address: this.senderId,
            }
        ]);
    }
----

A further in depth explanation in the custom transactions deep dive article can be found on {url_blog_statestore}[our blog^].
The link opens the section `B/ Combining Filters`.

== 3.2 Finish the transport

The last custom transaction required to be implemented is the `FinishTransportTransaction`, which will complete the transport of the packet.

When reaching the recipient of the packet, the carrier passes the packet to the recipient.
The recipient needs to sign the `FinishTransportTransaction`, this verifies that the packet has been passed on to the recipient.

When sending the transaction, the recipient needs to specify the following criteria:

* `packetID`: The ID of the packet that the recipient received.
* `status`: The status of the transport, which has 2 options: `"success"` or `"fail"`.

This transaction will perform the following:

* If `status="success"`
** Send `postage` to the carrier's account.
** Unlock `security` in the carrier's account.
** Increase `trust` of the carrier +1.
** Set packet `status` to `success`.
* If `status="fail"`
** Send `postage` to the sender's account.
** Add `security` to the sender's account, and nullify `lockedSecurity` from the account for the carrier.
** Decrease `trust` of the carrier by -1.
** Set packet `status` to `fail`.

=== Explanation: Caching data based on data from the db

It may be required to cache accounts or other data from the database, depending on other data that is stored in the database.

To achieve this, the points listed below must be followed:

. Cache the data with `store.account.cache`.
. Save the data as a constant with `store.account.get`.
. It is now possible to use the newly created constant to cache the rest of the data, as shown in the code snippet below:

.`prepare()` function of `finish-transport.js`
[source,js]
----
async prepare(store) {
    /**
     * Get packet account
     */
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: this.asset.packetId,
        }
    ]);
    /**
     * Get sender and recipient accounts of the packet
     */
    const pckt = await store.account.get(this.asset.packetId);
    await store.account.cache([
        {
            address: pckt.asset.carrier,
        },
        {
            address: pckt.asset.sender,
        },
    ]);
}
----

=== Task: Implement the logic in `applyAsset()` for a successful transport

{url_github_transport_finish83}[Write your own logic or the case of a successful transport of the packet here.^]

When the recipient receives the packet from the carrier, the recipient has to sign and send the `FinishTransportTransaction`.
If the recipient considers the transport successful, then the carrier should be rewarded accordingly and the packet status will be updated to `success`.

TIP: More information can be found in the code comments of `finish-transport.js`

**Important: To verify your implementation of `applyAsset()`, please compare it with the {url_github_transport_solutions_finish}[solution^].**

== 3.3 Test out the full workflow with the client app

[[check_status]]
=== Check the status in the `lightAlarmTransaction`

At this point the entire workflow should be implemented with the status of the different packets.
If a packet is currently in `ongoing`  or `alarm` status, then to send an alarm follow the instructions described below:

Insert the code snippet listed below in the `applyAsset()` function of {url_github_transport_alarmtx39}[light-alarm.js^], before the code that applies the changes to the database accounts.

If the status is not in `ongoing` or `alarm`, it will create a new `TransactionError`, push it to the `errors` list, and then return it.

IMPORTANT: This snippet must be inserted twice: Once in `transaction/light-alarm.js` on the local machine, and also in the `light-alarm.js` on the raspberry pi.

[source,js]
----
const packet = store.account.get(this.senderId);
if (packet.asset.status !== 'ongoing' && packet.asset.status !== 'alarm') {
    errors.push(
        new TransactionError(
            'Transaction invalid because delivery is not "ongoing".',
            this.id,
            'packet.asset.status',
            packet.asset.status,
            `Expected status to be equal to "ongoing" or "alarm"`,
        )
    );

    return errors;
}
----

=== Register all transaction types with the node app

Please follow the required steps below to uncomment all of the custom transactions, in order to register them with the node application:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');
const RegisterPacketTransaction = require('../transactions/register-packet');
const StartTransportTransaction = require('../transactions/start-transport');
const FinishTransportTransaction = require('../transactions/finish-transport');
const LightAlarmTransaction = require('../transactions/light-alarm');

configDevnet.label = 'lisk-transport';
configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true;

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);
app.registerTransaction(RegisterPacketTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(StartTransportTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(FinishTransportTransaction);
app.registerTransaction(LightAlarmTransaction);

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });

----

=== Try it out in the client app

Now try to start or re-start the `node`, `client` and `iot` application, exactly as performed earlier in xref:{url_tutorials_transport_1_client}[Step 2.3 in Part 2] of this tutorial.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the client app through the web browser.

[TIP]
====
The prepared account credentials for the sender, recipient, and carrier can be found in `client/accounts.json`.

These credentials are already pre-filled in the different forms in the client app.

.The different users in Lisk transport can be seen below:

==== Initialize a new packet account

Go to `http://localhost:3000/initialize` and copy the packet credentials {url_github_transport_iot}[in your tracking script^] on the Raspberry Pi.

.Create new packet credentials
image:1-initialize.png[Initialize packet account]

==== Register the packet

Firstly, open the {url_register_packet}[Register Packet] page and complete the form in order to register your packet in the network.

IMPORTANT: Use the address of the packet credentials as the packet ID that was created in the previous step.

TIP: Set `minTrust` to `0`, as there is no carrier present in the system yet that has more than `0` trustpoints.

.Sender posts the `RegisterPacket` transaction to register the packet on the network.
image:2-register.png[register packet]

.Check the `Packet & Carrier` page to see if the packet status is now "pending"
image:3-pending.png[packet pending]

If the packet is now opened at this point, then the light alarm transaction should fail as the packet should have the wrong `status`.
It should display the following error message:

[source, js]
----
[
  {
    "message": "Transaction invalid because delivery is not \"ongoing\".",
    "name": "TransactionError",
    "id": "5902807582253136271",
    "dataPath": "packet.asset.status",
    "actual": "pending",
    "expected": "Expected status to be equal to \"ongoing\" or \"alarm\""
  }
]
----

==== Fund the carrier account

Before the packet transport starts, it is necessary to transfer some tokens into the empty carrier account.
This is required as the carrier needs to lock the `security` in the carriers account, in order to start the transport.

To perform this task, go to the {url_faucet}[Faucet page] and enter the carrier address(`6795425954908428407L`), followed by the amount of tokens to be transferred to this account.

Please ensure that enough tokens are transferred so that the carrier can afford to lock the `security` of the packet, that was defined in the previous step whereby the packet was registered in the network.

TIP: This can be checked on the `Accounts` page, to see if the carrier received the tokens successfully.

image:4-faucet.png[Fund carrier]

==== Start transport

The carrier is required to post the transaction on the {url_start_transport}[Start Transport] page in order  to initiate the transport.

The carrier is now required to specify the `packetId`.

The transaction will only be accepted if the carrier has enough `trust` and `security` for the specified packet.

.Carrier posts the `StartTransport` transaction, and then receives the packet from the sender.
image:5-start.png[start transport]

.API response
image:22-register-response.png[finish transport]

.Check the `Packet & Carrier` page to see if the packet status has changed to "ongoing".
image:6-ongoing.png[packet account 2]

IMPORTANT: The light alarm will be extinguished after posting the  `StartTransport` and before posting the `FinishTransport`.
This occurs due to the status check added in the section <<check_status, Check for status in the lightAlarmTransaction>>.

image:7-alarm.png[packet alarm]

==== Finish transport

When the carrier passes the packet to the recipient, the recipient will sign the final {url_finish_transport}[FinishTransport] transaction, which will complete the transport of the packet.

Only the `packetId`, and the `status`, which can be either `fail` or `success` needs to be specified here.

To help with the decision of the final status, the recipient can inspect the packet after receiving it.
Please be aware that due to the IoT device inside the packet, the recipient can also check in the client app if the packet triggered any alarm.

NOTE: In case the recipient does not receive the packet after a reasonable amount of time, the recipient should also send the `FinishTransport` transaction, (most likely with `status=fail`).

.The recipient posts the `FinishTransport` transaction, once the packet has been received from the carrier.
image:8-finish.png[finish transport]
Check if the transport has been successful or if it has failed, then verify the changes accordingly in the accounts on the `Packet&Carrier` page.

.Transport fail

Once all of the above steps have been completed, a simple and fully working proof of concept of a decentralized supply chain tracking system is now running on your machine.

IMPORTANT: Time to celebrate! \o/
