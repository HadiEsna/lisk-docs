The open Lisk communication architecture is based on {url_ipc_socket}[IPC Unix Sockets^] and {url_websocket}[WebSocket (WS)^].
The xref:{url_advanced_architecture}[Application] can be configured to either expose an IPC or a WS API that can be used by internal components such as modules and plugins, as well as by any external service like other scripts in JS, a tool in Rust, or a Python daemon.
The Lisk SDK offers two different RPC API modes: `ipc` (Inter-process communication) and `ws` (WebSocket).
If the node and the frontend are running on the same machine, it is recommended to use the `ipc` mode.
To enable the API to be reachable from remote, use the `ws` option.

TIP: For more information about the configuration of the RPC endpoints, check out the xref:{url_guides_config_rpc}[configuration guide].

[[the-api-client]]
== The API client (external communication)

The xref:{url_references_elements_apiclient}[] simplifies to send API requests to a blockchain application via IPC or WS.

It can be imported in any JS client application.

It  provides an interface to *subscribe* to all events and to *invoke* actions of the blockchain application and its' modules & plugins.

TIP: To conveniently communicate with a blockchain application, use the `apiClient` which is included in the xref:{url_references_elements_client}[@liskhq/lisk-client] and the {url_npm_lisk_sdk}[lisk-sdk^] packages.

=====
WS API client example::
+
--
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient } = require('@liskhq/lisk-client');
let clientCache;

const getClient = async () => {
  if (!clientCache) {
    clientCache = await apiClient.createWSClient('ws://localhost:8080/ws');
  }
  return clientCache;
};

const apiRequest = async () => {
  const client = await getClient();
  const blockAtHeight123 = await client.block.getByHeight(123);
  client.subscribe('app:block:new', ( data ) => {
    console.log("new block:",data);
  });
  return blockAtHeight123;
};

apiRequest().then((val) => {
  console.log("val:",val);
});

IPC API client example::
+
--
[source,js]
----
const { apiClient } = require('lisk-sdk');
let clientCache;

const getClient = async () => {
    if (!clientCache) {
        clientCache = await apiClient.createIPCClient('~/.lisk/my-app');
    }
    return clientCache;
};

const apiRequest = async () => {
  const client = await getClient();

  client.subscribe('app:block:new', ( data ) => {
    console.log("new block:",data);
  });
  return blockAtHeight123;
};

apiRequest().then((val) => {
  console.log("val:",val);
});

== Channels

All modules and plugins have access to a `channel` to communicate with the application via actions and events.

=== Channel for modules

The channel in modules has one purpose: it allows a module to publish events to the application which were defined in the <<events>> property of the module.

The channel is accessible inside of a module under `this._channel`.
It is used especially in the xref:{url_intro_modules_lifecycle}[lifecycle-hooks], to publish the events of the module.

The following function is available for a `channel` inside a module:

* `publish(eventName: string, data?: object)`: Publishes an event.

This is an example how to use the channel to publish an event:

[source,js]
----
this._channel.publish('hello:newHello', {
  sender: transaction._senderAddress.toString('hex'),
  hello: helloAsset.helloString
});
----

The above code example will publish the event `hello:newHello` to the application, and attach an object which is containing the sender address and the hello message of the last sent xref:{url_guides_asset}[hello transaction].

=== Channel for plugins

The channel is used inside of the xref:{url_intro_plugins_load}[load()] function of a plugin.

The following functions are available for a `channel` inside a plugin:

* `publish(eventName: string, data?: object)`: Publishes an event.
* `subscribe(eventName: string, cb: EventCallback)`: Subscribes to an event.
* `once(actionName: string, cb: EventCallback)`: Executes the callback only once, when receiving the event for the first time.
* `invoke(actionName: string, params?: object)`: Invokes an action.

[source,js]
----
channel.subscribe('app:block:new', ({ data }) => {
    const decodedBlock = this.codec.decodeBlock(data.block);
    this._knownTimestamps.push(decodedBlock.header.timestamp);
    channel.publish('myPlugin:timestamp', { timestamp: decodedBlock.header.timestamp });
});
----

== Aliases

<<events>> and <<actions>> are identified by their alias.

Example alias:

 "monitor:getTransactionStats"

The alias always consists of the following parts:

. *Prefix:* Consists of the module or plugin name that provides the respective action or event.
Equals `app` if it's an xref:{url_advanced_rpc}[application event or action].
The prefix `monitor` in this example is referring the the xref:{url_references_plugins_monitor}[].
. *Separator:*
Prefix and suffix are always separated by a colon `:`.
. *Suffix:* The respective name of the event or action.

== Interfaces

A blockchain application communicates via <<actions>> and <<events>> which can be invoked (actions) or subscribed to (events) via xref:{url_glossary_rpc}[Remote-Procedure-Calls (RPCs)].

The different components of the application each have access to different parts of these interfaces.
This is summarized in the following table.

A green..

* ... `reply` means, the component can reply to this kind of RPC request.
* ... `invoke` means, the component can invoke this kind of RPC request.
* ... `publish` means, the component can publish events.
* ... `subscribe` means, the component can subscribe to events.

== Actions

Actions are invoked to receive specific data from the blockchain application.
Actions are part of the request / response API, and are invoked via Remote-Procedure-Calls (RPCs).

The following components can *expose* actions

* xref:{url_intro_modules}[]
* xref:{url_intro_plugins}[]
* and the application itself, see xref:{url_advanced_rpc_actions}[application actions]

The following components can *invoke* actions:

* Plugins
* External services/applications

=== How to invoke actions

The first argument is always the <<aliases,alias>>.
If input data is required, it is provided as second argument.

=====

== Events

If an event is published it is immediately received by all of the subscribers of the event.
Events are part of the public publish / subscribe API of a blockchain application.

The following components can *publish* events:

* xref:{url_intro_modules}[]
* xref:{url_intro_plugins}[]
* and the application itself, see xref:{url_advanced_rpc_events}[application events]

The following components can *subscribe* to events:

* Plugins
* External services / applications

=== How to publish and subscribe to events

Events are published inside lifecycle hooks of the module.
The `channel` is available inside the lifecycle hooks, which allows to subscribe and publish to events, as well as invoking actions in the network.

.Publishing an event
[source,typescript]
----
channel.publish('pluginAlias:timestamp', { info: 'sample' });
----

Example for subscribing to an event by utilizing <<the-api-client>>:

.Subscribing to an event
[source,typescript]
----
client.subscribe('pluginAlias:timestamp', ( data ) => {
  console.log(data);
});
