== What are blockchain applications?

A blockchain application is any kind of application which uses its' own blockchain as a database layer.

More specifically, in the Lisk documentation, every time we talk about blockchain applications, we refer to applications that are running on blockchains that are compatible with xref:{url_protocol}[].

.Examples of blockchain applications
****
Examples of blockchain applications can be found in the tutorials, such as the xref:{url_tutorials_nft}[] or the xref:{url_tutorials_srs}[] application.

Additionally, check out the apps list at {url_lisk_apps}
****

== Architecture of blockchain applications

=== Network topology diagram
A blockchain application generally consists of a network of servers, which are also called *nodes* in this context.

A typical network of nodes is illustrated in the diagram below:

image:intro/node-network.png[]

.Shared on-chain logic, optional off-chain logic
****
All nodes in the network need to share the same <<on-chain-logic>> (Modules), while the <<off-chain-logic>> (Plugins) of the application may differ from node to node.
****

=== P2P: Unstructured partial mesh network
The P2P network of nodes is unstructured, which means that all nodes are equal participants in the network.

It is also a partial mesh network, which means that every node is only connected to a small subset of nodes in the network.

Unstructured partial mesh networks allow nodes to share information in the network in a very expeditious and secure manner with all other nodes.
They also possess the ability to scale extremely well, even for large networks with thousands of connected nodes.

=== Blockchain application architecture diagram

All important components of a blockchain application are displayed in the diagram below:

image:architecture.png[lisk-framework-architecture]

=== On-chain logic

The on-chain architecture is a layer of abstraction that provides a collection of features to configure and run any business logic on the blockchain.

In short, the on-chain logic:

* introduces state mutations through blocks footnoteref:[block_footnote,For more information about blocks, check out the xref:{url_protocol_blocks}[\] page of the Lisk protocol.] or transactions footnoteref:[tx_footnote,For more information about transactions, check the xref:{url_protocol_transactions}[\] page of the Lisk protocol.].
* is part of the blockchain protocol.
* is verifiable by anyone by synchronizing with the blockchain.
* is located in modules.

.When to create a module
****
xref:{url_introduction_module}[] are able to perform the following:

* Define how data is stored on the blockchain.
* Define logic which is executed per block footnoteref:[block_footnote].
* Define logic which is executed per transaction footnoteref:[tx_footnote].
****

[[default-modules]]
The following modules are already included in the xref:{url_advanced_architecture_application}[default application], they provide a basic blockchain application with a DPoS blockchain which allows basic token transfers between users:

xref:{url_references_dpos_module}[], xref:{url_references_token_module}[], xref:{url_references_keys_module}[], xref:{url_references_sequence_module}[]

To extend and customize the application, register additional modules to the application.

To add a new module to your application, either reuse an already existing module from another blockchain application, or create a new module based on the specific needs of your application.

=== Off-chain logic
In short, the off-chain logic:

* introduces new blockchain application features.
* is not part of the blockchain protocol.
* is optional to execute on a full node.
* is located in plugins.

.When to create a plugin
****
xref:{url_introduction_plugin}[] are able to perform the following:

* search the blockchain data.
* aggregate the blockchain data.
* provide a UI for the blockchain application.
* automate the blockchain logic, such as automatically sending transactions.
* add a proxy to the application interfaces.
****

The default application does not include any plugins by default, however, the SDK is bundled with a few common plugins which can be directly imported from the Lisk SDK:

xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_forger_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_monitor_plugin}[], xref:{url_references_report_misbbehavior_plugin}[]

To extend and customize the application, register the desired plugins to the application.

To add a new plugin to your application, either reuse an already existing plugin from another blockchain application, or create a new plugin based on the specific needs of your application.

=== Communication interfaces / APIs

image::intro/communication-architecture.png[]

The communication architecture of the Lisk SDK allows internal application components and external services to communicate to the blockchain application via various channels.

The Lisk SDK provides two industry standard communication protocols: Inter Process Communication (IPC) and Web Sockets (WS).
The communication protocol of the blockchain application is changed in the xref:{url_advanced_architecture_config}[configuration].

It is possible to communicate to modules and plugins directly by invoking xref:{url_advanced_communication_actions}[actions] via a RPC request, or by subscribing to xref:{url_advanced_communication_events}[events].

It is recommended to use the IPC/WebSocket protocols where possible, as they provide a more enhanced performance in regard to the response times (see the blog post: {url_blog_benchmark}[Benchmarking Lisk Core v3.0.0 against Lisk Core v2.1.6]).
However, if you prefer an HTTP API, it is possible to add support for custom APIs by registering additional plugins, such as the xref:{url_references_http_plugin}[].
//We also recommend to try out xref:{url_service}[Lisk Service], which provides a much more comprehensive API compared to the HTTP API plugin.

For more information about the communication architecture, check out the xref:{url_advanced_communication}[advanced explanation] of the communication architecure.

=== Frontend & backend

Blockchain applications usually consist of a frontend and a backend part, just as normal web applications.

In contrast to normal server-client applications, there is not one central backend, but rather a whole network of nodes which together secure and maintain the status of the blockchain.
Each node can handle complex business logic and provides a flexible and customizable API.
The blockchain itself is used as a database layer for the application.

The frontend allows users to interact conveniently with the blockchain application.
The implementation of a frontend is totally flexible.
For example, this can be achieved in the following ways:

[loweralpha]
. Create a new xref:{url_introduction_plugin}[plugin] for the blockchain application.
An example implementation of a frontend as a plugin is the {url_github_lns_dashboard}[LNS UI plugin] for the example application *Lisk Name Service*.
. Use your favorite framework/ programming language to develop a user interface, and communicate to the node via the <<communication-interfaces-apis>>.
An example is the frontend of the {url_github_srs}[SRS example appllication^] , which has been developed with React.js.
. For later requirements in a production environment, a middleware similar to Lisk Service should be used, which will aggregate the data from the blockchain network and possibly other 3rd party sources as well.
The frontend can then request this data via API requests from the middleware.

== Blockchain applications vs. dApps

As blockchain applications are also in a sense decentralized applications, you may wonder what is the difference between blockchain applications and dApps, or if there is any difference at all.

In short, the main difference between dApps and blockchain applications is that blockchain applications each run on their own blockchain/sidechain, while dApps are sharing the blockchain network with other dApps.

dApps are generally constructed as smart contracts, for example on the Ethereum blockchain.
The development of blockchain applications is quite different, because it is much more similar to building a normal web application.

Most functionalities of smart contracts can be implemented in blockchain applications much easier and in a more straight forward manner.
However, there is one important difference here to dApps, when it comes to applying new <<on-chain-logic>> to the application:
New smart contracts can be directly applied on the running blockchain while adding new on-chain logic to blockchain applications always requires a hard fork in the network.
Therefore, blockchain applications are less flexible than dApps, when it comes to uploading new logic on the running chain.

If the flexible characteristics of smart contracts are desired inside a blockchain application, it is of course also possible to develop a blockchain application which supports smart contracts.
For example, a new module could be added to the application, which accepts smart contracts.
This way it is possible to have the best of both worlds combined.

Additionally, smart contracts can reuse an already existing blockchain, which saves time when launching the application, as it is not necessary to take care of setting up an independent blockchain network, finding delegates footnoteref:[delegate_footnote,For more information about delegates, check the xref:{url_protocol_consensus}[Consensus algorithm\] page of the Lisk protocol.], etc.

Blockchain applications on the contrary rely on their own blockchain, and therefore also need to take care of maintaining their own network.
In the beginning, this will make the launch of the application a little more complex, but having an independent network comes along with numerous benefits, which are covered in the following paragraphs.

The Lisk documentation is referring to applications built with the Lisk SDK as "blockchain applications" and not "dApps", to clarify the difference that applications are not sharing a common blockchain, but instead are each running on their own chain.
As a result blockchain applications have the following advantages:

* Lower transaction fees, as high traffic of one blockchain application has no effect on other blockchain applications.
* The blockchain for the application can be designed with the optimal characteristics for the specific use case (for example by adjusting the block time or the number of delegates, or even changing the whole consensus algorithm).
* A much more scalable blockchain, as it only handles the data from one blockchain application.
Therefore it is growing much slower in size, and doesn't suffer so much from potential bottlenecks in the network, which can happen during times of high workload on many different dApps.
* Interoperability: Register a blockchain application as a sidechain to connect it to the Lisk Mainchain (coming {url_lisk_roadmap}[soon^]).
This will provide seamless interoperability to the Lisk Mainchain and all of its' connected sidechains.
