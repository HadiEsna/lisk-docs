<h1 class="page">How blockchain works</h1>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="overview"><a class="anchor" href="#overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described on the previous page from a high-level perspective blockchain is basically a 'digital ledger' which has many functionalities and use cases.
It can also be thought of as a digital methodology to store data, whereby the data is encapsulated in blocks, and once the blocks are chained together they cannot be changed or altered, thus making them immutable.
Once a block of data is added to the blockchain it will remain publicly viewable to anyone at anytime.
This is a highly beneficial system as it enables permanent records to be kept, enabling the storage of almost any type of record.
For example, it could be virtually anything such as medical records, financial transactions, property rights, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start to break down how the blockchain works, and before we delve into the detailed contents of a block, firstly we need to understand how the blocks are linked together, this is accomplished by using cryptography.
Therefore, each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, the transaction data,  and a timestamp.
This will be explained in more detail further in this section.
As previously mentioned once created, the blocks are immutable and cannot be changed retroactively.
The only way this could be achieved would be by altering the subsequential blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="key-characteristics-of-blockchain"><a class="anchor" href="#key-characteristics-of-blockchain"></a>Key characteristics of blockchain</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 4 core characteristics attributed to the blockchain which are covered below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decentralization – The contents of each block in the blockchain can be accessed by any node on the network, as they are essentially network copies that are present on all participating nodes.
Therefore, there is no central entity that holds each block in the chain, so this creates decentralization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consensus Driven – A consensus model independently verifies each block on the blockchain, and provides certain rules for validating a block, which may utilise key resources such as computing power, in order to demonstrate that this has been accomplished.
For example, with regard to Bitcoin this is known as the mining process.
There are different types of consensus models which will be covered further in this section, however suffice to say that a consensus model is able to function independently, and does not require any form of central authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immutability – A blockchain can be considered as a permanent, unchangeable, and irreversible record of transactions.
Hence, once a block is created and added to the blockchain it ensures the transaction is completely trustable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency – A blockchain by its very nature provides total open transparency.
A full transaction history  can be viewed by any party, as it is in effect an open file.
Therefore another highly beneficial advantage is that a blockchain creates provenance, as all transactions can be easily audited from the first to the last entry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="consensus-mechanisms"><a class="anchor" href="#consensus-mechanisms"></a>Consensus mechanisms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to understand consensus within the blockchain ecosystem.
Basically, a consensus mechanism is a methodology deployed by nodes to agree on, and validate the data content of a block before it becomes part of a blockchain.
The block containing this data is then distributed to all the nodes within the network.
The consensus algorithm is responsible for ensuring that only 1 copy of the data encapsulated in each block exists within each node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various consensus mechanisms exist today, however the 4 main mechanisms that are widely used consist of the Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Delegated-Proof-of-Stake, and Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance mechanisms, which are explained below:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="consensus-algorithms"><a class="anchor" href="#consensus-algorithms"></a>Consensus algorithms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To put it in a nutshell, a consensus algorithm can be thought of as a necessary procedure which results in ensuring all peers of a blockchain network come to a common agreement of the current state of the network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="proof-of-work-pow"><a class="anchor" href="#proof-of-work-pow"></a>Proof-of-Work (PoW)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proof of Work is probably the most well-known and established consensus mechanism, as it is utilized by Bitcoin.
However, when compared to the other consensus mechanisms, it is somewhat inefficient as it requires a high amount of energy and processing power to reach a consensus, therefore being rather cumbersome and expensive to operate.
Basically to validate transactions it requires the nodes to solve an arbitrary mathematical problem or complex equations, which prevents the network being hacked, and also provides a high level of security.
It is also widely used for mining cryptocurrencies and minting new tokens.</p>

<h3 id="proof-of-stake-pos"><a class="anchor" href="#proof-of-stake-pos"></a>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To explain PoS briefly, it allows the users to stake an asset/token which in turn opens up the possibility to be chosen as a validator of a new block, which then allows transaction fees, or newly minted tokens to be collected from the block as a reward.
Staking is defined as an amount of tokens/assets that are held by the node.
The proof-of-stake-mechanism uses a random algorithm for consensus building and eliminates the need for complex mathematical calculations, hence reducing the overall computing power and energy required.
Alternatively, the nodes that hold the most tokens/assets have the power to validate the transactions, which in turn results in this node receiving a reward, usually in newly minted tokens.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos"><a class="anchor" href="#delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos"></a>Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DPoS works in a similar fashion to PoS, however one of the key advantages is that it utilizes a delegation and voting mechanism, which in turn incentives the users to use their staked collateral to secure the network.
To allow this mechanism to be both efficient and effective at performing transaction validations, various different components of delegated proof of stake exist.
Ultimately, the DPoS is considered the most advantageous mechanism here, as it was designed to negate most of the limitations that exist with PoW and PoS.
This consensus algorithm used in DPoS utilizes a unique election system that is able to select nodes which are able to perform block verification.
In this system, generally  delegates are voted in based upon their reputation.
Each user who holds a minimum of one token/coin with the DPoS blockchain has the ability to vote specifically for the nodes that they want to perform the transaction validations.
This is the consensus mechanism used by Lisk, and hence every Lisk token holder is able to vote for delegates, and dependent on these votes, certain delegates are allowed to add blocks to the blockchain in a specific order.
The delegates are actually normal Lisk accounts that have performed a delegate registration transaction.
The whole process can be considered as the most democratic method of voting, as it does not rest on the users that possess the highest amount of tokens, as just because a particular user has many tokens, that does not authorize this user to validate and confirm transactions.
All the users that maintain tokens in their accounts are able to select a group of delegates to perform this task.
Furthermore, the DPoS has the advantage of being able to execute transactions and verifications much faster, which results in higher scalability.</p>

<h3 id="byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft"><a class="anchor" href="#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft"></a>Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance (BFT)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BFT mechanism was designed in a manner whereby it is able to tolerate failures in the network, coupled with being able to withstand malicious attacks and corrupted data.
In a nutshell the BFT mechanism ensures that the same guaranteed data is received by every node present in the network.
In essence, it allows consensus to be reached regardless if some of the nodes fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, there are 3 key features whereby BFT is able to improve the blockchain, and they are listed below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Safety: If 2 conflicting blocks occur on the network, then assuming two-thirds of the active delegates adhere honestly to the protocol, then these 2 conflicting blocks will not be finalized on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accountability: In the case whereby the protocol is violated by the delegate, they will be held responsible for this.
The key requirements for BFT must be accomplished by the nodes within a blockchain network, therefore, it is imperative they are deterministic and must begin with the same state for practical BFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liveness: New blocks can still be finalized on the network, even in the case whereby one third of the active delegates are offline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of being able  to tolerate an amount of  Byzantine process failures or crashes, whilst ensuring the network continues to function is defined as Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT).
To achieve BFT consensus the following requirements must be met:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Termination: An output is decided by every non-faulty process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreement: The same output is decided by every non-faulty process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validity: Every process starts with the same input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrity: The consensus value and all non-faulty process decisions achieved in point 2 above, need to have been put forward by some non-faulty process.</p>

<h3 id="peer-2-peer-networks"><a class="anchor" href="#peer-2-peer-networks"></a>Peer-2-Peer networks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The usage of a peer-to-peer model in blockchain offers various benefits as compared to a standard client-server based system.
By its very nature a P2P system offers a high level of security, as it is virtually immune to any Denial-of-Service (DoS, attacks), any also any censorship by a central governing body (for example, assets cannot be frozen or manipulated by any entity).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarise, if blockchain technology is deployed using a P2P network architecture, then this will result in greater freedom, security, immutability, and enhanced decentralization.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="unstructured-p2p-networks"><a class="anchor" href="#unstructured-p2p-networks"></a>Unstructured P2P networks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an unstructured P2P network there is no organization, hence the nodes are able to communicate and connect randomly.
Such networks are more suited towards social platforms, or any type of system which experiences high churn rates.
However, such networks require a high amount of processing power and may incur long delays.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="structured-p2p-networks"><a class="anchor" href="#structured-p2p-networks"></a>Structured P2P networks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A structured network can be considered as the opposite to a unstructured network, and is organised in a manner whereby the nodes are able to utilize efficient search mechanisms.
This can be performed by the nodes using a hash function.
However, although they are considered to be more efficient, they can be considered as somewhat centralized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="hybrid-p2p-networks"><a class="anchor" href="#hybrid-p2p-networks"></a>Hybrid P2P networks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hybrid P2P networks are actually a combination of the client-server model and the peer-to-peer architecture.
This can offer the best of both worlds, and operate more efficiently as they generally contain an index/central server which can also connect and provide connections between the network nodes.
Lisk uses what is known as an unstructured P2P network, whereby the nodes randomly connect to each other.
This methodology is highly beneficial as the nodes then broadcast their new transactions, which results in synchronizing all their local copies of the blockchain.

<h3 id="cryptography"><a class="anchor" href="#cryptography"></a>Cryptography</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptography is not a new concept, and ultimately is used to ensure secure communication between 2 parties can be established over an unsecure connection.
This can be accomplished by using an encryption mechanism as depicted in the example diagram below, whereby a plain text document is sent as a ciphered version to the recipient.
The recipient can only decrypt the ciphered text if he or she holds the identical symmetrical encryption key.
Therefore, this can be transmitted over any unsecure medium, as regardless of any third party or malicious actors intercepting this, they would not be able to decrypt the text, rendering it useless to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../_images/intro/cryptography.png" alt="cryptography"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To delve a bit further into cryptography in blockchain, it is helpful to be aware of the 3 types of cryptography deployed today.
These can be broken down ito the following three types:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Symmetric Key:  This is the simplest method, as 1 common key is used for both the encryption and decryption process.
In this case it is necessary to ensure the transfer of the common key can be performed safely from the sender to the recipient.
It is also referred to as secret-key cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asymmetric Key:  This type of encryption functions by using a pair of keys.
This comprises an  encryption key, and a decryption key, and is more commonly known as a public key and private key.
Basically, The algorithm deployed for this method generates both a private key and a unique public key.
The private key is as its name implies, is kept private, and the public key is openly shared.
It is also called Public-Key Cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hash Functions:
This function does not utilise any keys, as it takes the contents of the plain text and deploys a cipher, which is used to generate a hash value of a fixed length from the plain text.
Hence, it is virtually impossible for the contents of this plain text to be unravelled from the cipher text.
Therefore, hashing does not only provide the required security, as described earlier on the previous page, it is also deterministic and has the ability to provide immutability as well, which as we have learnt is highly beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lisk maintains a cryptography package which contains all the cryptographic functionalities required when interacting with the Lisk ecosystem, and can be used on both the server and client side.</p>

<h3 id="state-machine"><a class="anchor" href="#state-machine"></a>State machine</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A State machine is considered to be concept whereby the definition relates to a machine that can have multiple states, however only one state is possible at any one given time.
Hence, a state in this case refers to the current state of the blockchain system and its transactions that are responsible for triggering state transitions.
With regard to a blockchain system, it can be deemed as a deterministic, replicated state machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../_images/intro/state-machine.png" alt="state machine">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The state transition refers to the changes that occur in the state machine after a specific event has occurred.
The state store can mutate the state of the actual blockchain data, and it can also retrieve data from the blockchain.
Therefore, it is best thought of as a temporary data structure that holds a temporary state while processing a block.
Furthermore, it maintains a temporary state that exists during the processing of a block, as it exposes an interface which enables and results in the finalization of the snapshots.
From a high level perspective, the state store can be broken down into 3 separate states, namely the Accounts, the Chain, and the Consensus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, the account store handles token transfers, keys, and registering delegates.
Secondly, the chain state store is responsible for the delegate vote weights, the block headers of the 3 previous rounds, the network identifier, the total fees burnt, and finally the rewards for last block.
Thirdly, the consensus store contains the validators information and the finalized block height, including the BFT voting ledger, and furthermore regarding the BFT, the consensus store holds the internal state.
Finally, this is explained in more depth in the <a href="#{state_store}">Modules and Assets</a> page covering the state store changes and execution logic.</p>
